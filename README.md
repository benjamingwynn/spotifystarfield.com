This project is dead. Spotify killed it.

Spotify killed this project in two world-breaking ways:

- Revoking my API key after already being a public accessible application, and not reinstating it after repeatedly reaching out.
- Silently [removing the audio analytics API endpoint](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-for-Developers/Changes-to-Web-API/td-p/6540414/), which this required to work.

**Because of this experience, I'd strongly recommend nobody else ever write an application that integrates into Spotify.**

So this no longer works, and will likely never work again, but I'll keep the code hosted here for posterity. 

Thanks to Tommy W for all his help and suggestions.
